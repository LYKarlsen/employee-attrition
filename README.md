# employee-attrition: using machine learning (ML) to model employees at risk of attrition

## Context:
This is a demo project. A big company has thousands of employees spread out across the globe. The company believes in hiring the best talent available and retaining them for as long as possible. A huge amount of resources is spent on retaining existing employees through various initiatives. The Head of People Operations wants to bring down the cost of retaining employees. For this, he proposes limiting the incentives to only those employees who are at risk of attrition. The goal is to identify patterns in characteristics of employees who leave the organization. This information should be used to predict if an employee is at risk of attrition and target them with incentives.
